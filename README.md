# OpenInvite
OpenInvite is an iOS application that is still under development.  After logging in using the Facebook API, OpenInvite allows users to post open invitations to activities and events. Friends are then able to browse a feed of OpenInvites in their area and join in the click of a button.  OpenInvite allows individuals to easily organize group events and activities. With OpenInvite, it's much easier to maintain relationships with friends that you may not have otherwise been in touch with. OpenInvite also allows individuals to easily meet new people through mutual acquaintances.
